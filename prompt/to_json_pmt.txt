Use the information below to extract a Resume JSON that strictly matches the schema.
INFORMATION (verbatim source; do NOT infer beyond this):
{text}
------------------
Return:
- ONE valid JSON object ONLY (no prose, no comments, no markdown fences).
- Must match the schema EXACTLY (no extra/missing fields, correct types).

Hard Rules (strict, no exceptions):
1 NO GUESSING, NO FABRICATION, NO REWRITING FACTS.
- Only include data explicitly present in INFORMATION.
- If a value is uncertain/implicit/inferred treat as missing.
2 Do NOT transform or enrich content beyond minimal cleaning.
- Allowed: trim whitespace.
- Not allowed: paraphrasing, translating, normalizing entities, adding defaults not seen in source.
3 No extra fields beyond the schema. Arrays may be empty.
4 If contradictory values appear, prefer the one stated most explicitly (e.g., in structured headers). Do NOT merge or invent resolutions; if still ambiguous treat as missing.

Validation checklist BEFORE returning:
- JSON parses successfully.
- Keys and types match the schema exactly.
- No prose or markdown fences.
- No inferred/guessed values.
